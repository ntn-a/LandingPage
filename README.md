# LandingPage
Recreation of the landing page project from the Odin Project.
# Why is it the exact sample page?
I had originally assumed that the page we had to make was to be exactly like the one provided.
This was not the case but I still went ahead and made a landing page that is similar to 
the example one anyway.
# What did I learn?
The making of this page shows that I'm able to make use of HTML and CSS together to make a 
decent looking page. Obviously there is no functionality but once I get to that point then 
my github will start looking more interesting. For now, this is a good checkpoint for me 
as I have not spent that much time in web development.
